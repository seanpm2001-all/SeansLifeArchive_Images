# 2nd living room images

This folder contains images of the 2nd living room in my house in Walla Walla. The 2nd living room has the 3rd living room (very small) on the right, and the main living room (larger than the 2nd) further right of the 3rd living room.

This area is my daytime development area that I care for, and work in. Images for this directory normally regard layouts, cleaning, or changes.

You can view the images on GitHub by clicking/tapping [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansLifeArchive_Images_2nd-living-room).
